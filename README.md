## Overview

Welcome to **React Fast**, a FastAPI-based project that emphasizes a minimal boilerplate approach while adopting a Django-inspired app structure. Each app within this project encapsulates its own models, API endpoints, and services, fostering modularity and ease of maintenance.

Special thanks to [tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) and his project [full-stack-fastapi-template](https://github.com/fastapi/full-stack-fastapi-template), which inspired the creation of this project.

## Key Features
